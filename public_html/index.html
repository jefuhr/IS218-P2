      <li>With linux vi you are able to create, edit, and even delete files.</li>
      <li>You can remember how to use the vi editor with three simple steps; first you open up the file you want to edit using the command “vi textfile.example” and hitting the I character. Then you type in whatever text you would like to add. Then you hit semi-colon and “wq” to write and save your file </li>
      <li>There are some further vi commands that are useful such as “/string” to find occurrences of a specified string </li>

	</br> <b>IMPLMENTING PYLINT </b>
	</br> <b>factory</b> is an object for creating other objects 
	</br> <b>instantiation</b> is the realization of a predefined object
	</br> <b>objects </b> are the things you think about first in designing a program and they are also the units of code that are eventually derived from the process
	</br> <b>class </b> is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).
	</br> <b>namespace</b> is an object-oriented concept which allows for organization of variables, functions, and other elements of a program
	</br> <b>constructor </b>  is a special type of subroutine called to create an object.
	</br> <b>fixture</b> provides a defined, reliable and consistent context for the tests
	</br> <b>type hinting </b> means providing hints to function to only accept the given data type
	</br> <b>type casting </b> is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type	
	</br> <b>static </b> means that the particular member belongs to a type itself, rather than to an instance of that type	
	</br> <b>facade</b> is an object that serves as a front-facing interface masking more complex underlying or structural code.
	</br> <b>method </b>is a procedure associated with a message and an object.
	</br>

	<b> AAA TESTING </b>
	</br> 
		</br> <b>Arrange </b>inputs and targets. Arrange steps should set up the test case. 

		</br> <b>Act </b>on the target behavior. Act steps should cover the main thing to be tested.

		</br> <b>Assert</b> expected outcomes. Act steps should elicit some sort of response. Assert steps verify the goodness or badness of that response. 
		</br></br> AAA testing is simply setting up the test (arrange), testing the data set (act) and then giving a result of how good the data was in the given test (act). It simply gets more and more complex based on how complex	the test is.

	<b> Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction. </b>
	</br> <b>Encapsulation</b> is used in the calculation.py class. "def __init__ " is where it is implmented.   
	</br> <b>Inheritance</b> is used in the classes that use calculation.py. "class Addition(Calculation)" is an example in the addition.py class, now it can use anything in the calculation.py.  
	</br> <b>Polymorphism</b> is used in the calculation.py class to accept different types of data.
	</br> <b>Abstraction</b> is used in the calculation.py class so it can be used by any other class.
